# DEV-CON-1
The GDD for our first Development Contract (Mohawk College, GAME-10016-02) as well as the files/code/etc.

DEV-CON 1: THE GDD ZONE

Vision
The player would control a little fire sprite making it's way up a chimney, collecting soot. The fire sprite can move left and right, but can't jump - instead, they can travel on gusts of air (using the space bar). 

Goals
QUESTION: Is this "air draft propulsion" concept viable for a fun platformer?
WHY: "Upwardly-mobile" type platformers often involve planning how you jump very strategically, sometimes to the point of frustration (you can see this very well in a game like Jump King). If we added a form of propulsion that was not easily able to be calculated the same way a traditional platformer jump can, would that add even more frustration to the experience or be freeing to the player?

Mechanics
The game would have players platforming upwards (think Doodle Jump, Kid Icarus, etc.) towards an end goal. The PC can move left and right but can't jump, and are instead pushed upwards by gusts of air (space bar). The PC collects soot, which would fuel these hot air drafts needed to move upwards. 
The "innovate mechanic" in this instance is the air draft propulsion mechanic. 

Sources
An area to keep track of sources (just jot down a name and a link)

Rough Notes
(This is for our rough notes taken during meetings/class/etc. as it relates to the contract. As such, optimal formatting is not a priority here - copy and paste as you like!)
CONTROLLING AIR FLOW FOR THE FIRE? Still left and right to move, but space controls an airdraft?
Space is negative gravity
Follow cam
Box on each platform that is not affected by gravity (so you dont shoot up when the draft is below a platform)

Rocket LAUNCH
Propulsion via weapon 
Pogo stick?
gun/rocket launcher etc
Breakable platforms
Dissolving, breaking apart 
Physics
2D or 3D?
Kid icarus upwards momentum 


Player movement/weapons/the world?

Weather? Moon physics, etc
Weather platform, changing temp? Water, the sun, ice, etc
Area is hot, so you need to find water bottles around the map?
Grappling hook? jetpack?
Water = movement? The sun makes a (plant) character bigger or smaller based on exposure 
Resource/fuel = upward propulsion through level
Main mechanic = heat? Moving fire attempting to access wood 

Fire moving up, getting fuel 
Doodle jump-like
Unity fire, log assets, etc
Can fire destroy the past platforms?
Going up a chimney, getting soot?
Unity

What is the question:

Can we “spice up” movement?
Can we innovate on movement?
